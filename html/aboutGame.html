    <p><i>Final Fantasy IV,</i> known as <i>Final Fantasy II</i> for its initial North American release, is a
        role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo
        Entertainment System. Released in 1991, it is the fourth main installment of the Final Fantasy series.
        The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing
        powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group
        of allies. Final Fantasy IV introduced innovations that became staples of the Final Fantasy series
        and role-playing games in general. Its "Active Time Battle" system was used in five subsequent
        Final Fantasy games, and unlike prior games in the series, IV gave each character their own unchangeable
        character class.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Final Fantasy IV has been ported to several other platforms with varying differences. An enhanced remake,
            also called <i>Final Fantasy IV,</i> with 3D graphics was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007 and 2008. The
            game was re-titled <i>Final Fantasy II</i> during its initial release outside Japan as the original Final
            Fantasy II and Final Fantasy III had not been released outside Japan at the time. All later localizations,
            which began to appear after <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> (released worldwide under that title), used the original
            title.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The various incarnations of the game have sold more than four million copies worldwide. A sequel, <i>Final
            Fantasy IV: The After Years,</i> was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2008, and worldwide via the Wii
            Shop Channel on June 1, 2009. In 2011, both Final Fantasy IV and The After Years were released for the
            PlayStation Portable as part of the compilation <i>Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection,</i> which also
            included a new game, set between the two; Final Fantasy IV: Interlude. Ports of the Nintendo DS remake
            were released for iOS in 2012, for Android in 2013 and for Windows in 2014.</p>
